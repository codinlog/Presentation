        "A presentation is a special kind of dialog whose
        purpose is to present content on a secondary display. A Presentation is associated with the target Display at creation time and configures its context and resource configuration according to the display's metrics.
        Notably, the Context of a presentation is different from the context of its containing Activity. It is important to inflate the layout of a presentation and load other resources using the presentation's own context to ensure that assets of the correct size and density for the target display are loaded.
        A presentation is automatically canceled (see Dialog#cancel()) when the display to which it is
        attached is removed. An activity should take care of pausing and resuming whatever content is playing within the presentation whenever the activity itself is paused or resumed."
